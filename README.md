This is a Game Application, that plays in the console, that allows the user to play Connect four; the user can either play with another person on the same computer, or they can play aginst a simple AI that will try its best to prevent the user from winning. 

- 'R' represents the Red Player (P1)
- 'B' representes the Blue Player (P2 or AI/cpu)

*I created this in order to incorporate my more advanced knowledge of arrays, that I had learned about a couple months prior, with some new things I had learned about AIs. I wanted to try to create my own basic AI that could play with a real person in a game.
